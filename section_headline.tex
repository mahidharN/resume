Developer and designer JEE for several years, I also have development experience on the entire Java ecosystem (Android, J2ME on PDA and Javacard on NFC chipset). I am currently a software architect and remain passionate about my job and new technologies in general. Particularly interested in new uses and opportunities that can lead to the development of 4G on the territory, I wish to continue my career on innovative mobile development projects as a software architect and / or developer / designer.
